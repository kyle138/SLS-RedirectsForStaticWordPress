Everyone turns an old Pentium III desktop into a webserver just for fun right? In early 2007 I upgraded my computer and had to find something for my old one to do so I ended up installing CentOS and started hosting a WordPress blog. I ran that webserver in my house for over 6+ years until I eventually moved it into an AWS EC2 instance. Well it's been another 6+ years and I've moved it again, this time to S3 using the popular [WP2Static](https://wp2static.com/) plugin.

This has several benefits such as cost, speed, and security, but it breaks the legacy dynamic links. WordPress now offers permalinks which replaces the old dynamic **?p=123** queries with **/category/post-title/**. This works well for static hosting, but if you've been sharing the old dynamic links to your blog for years those will all be broken in S3. Unfortunately there's no one simple solution to redirect these dynamic links but with a CloudFront distribution sitting in front of your S3 bucket you can intercept these query strings and use Lambda@Edge to generate redirects to the new permalink URIs.

Unfortunately there's no pattern between the old and new URLs so I couldn't use a regex to generate the redirects. WordPress stores all of these in the 'posts' table of the database. The ID field matches the numeric value in the **?p=123** query and the **post_name** is the new permalink URI. There's also the 'users' table which holds the redirect values for any **?author=123** queries. And also the 'terms' table holds the values for any **?cat=123** queries. I output all of these to a redirects.json file.
```javascript
{
  "authors":
    {
      "1": {
        "redir": "author/kyle10001010"
      },
      "2": {
        "redir": "author/kyle10001010"
      }
    },
  "cats":
    {
      "1": {
        "redir": "category/1/"
      },
      "2": {
        "redir": "category/2/"
      }
    },
  "posts":
    {
      "0": {
        "redir": "/"
      },
      "1": {
        "redir": "post1/"
      },
      "2": {
        "redir": "post2/"
      }
    }
}
```

I store the redirects.json file in a separate S3 bucket. Not the same bucket that's hosting my static website because I don't necessarily want this file publicly available. Any requests to '/' with a querystring trigger the lambda which loads the redirects.json, looks up the ID, and returns the new permalink URI as a 301 redirect. CloudFront retrieves all other URIs directly from S3. The great news here is CloudFront caches these redirects for some time so future requests don't need to be looked up. Also the redirects.json file is assigned outside of the event handler so subsequent redirects are returned immediately as long as the Lambda container remains warm.

This hosting solution is cheaper too. Hosting a single micro EC2 instance isn't exactly expensive, it's only around $20 a month, but this new setup is essentially free. I'm hosting the source WordPress blog locally. Whenever I need to post an update to my blog (this is an admittedly rare occasion) I spin up my local LAMP environment, create or edit a post, then use the WP2Static plugin to generate the static files and deploy them to S3. The initial full deploy can take a while but subsequent updates actually deploy pretty quickly. The plugin will even create an invalidation to clear the CloudFront cache after each deployment making your updates immediately available. This has been a long time coming and overall I'm happy with my new hosting solution. I'm just curious what I'll switch to in another 6 years.
